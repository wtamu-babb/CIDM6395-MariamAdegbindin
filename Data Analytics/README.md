# Data Analytics Assessment

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an assessment of my competency in Data Analytics, highlighting my strengths, weaknesses, areas for improvement, and how my skills integrate with other areas of my coursework. It will serve as a foundation for my capstone portfolio and prototype project.

## 2. Competencies and Strengths
Through my coursework, I have developed strong skills in the following areas:

- **Data Preparation:** Proficient in cleaning, transforming and merging datasets to ready them for analysis.  
- **Data Visualization:** Skilled with Tableau, RapidMiner and Excel to craft compelling charts, dashboards and interactive reports.  
- **RapidMiner & R:** Confident in building predictive models, doing feature engineering and running advanced analytics workflows.  
- **SQL & Database Management:** Competent in writing complex SQL queries, designing relational schemas, and optimizing data retrieval.  
- **Business Intelligence:** Able to interpret key metrics and KPIs to inform strategic decisions and drive measurable improvements.

### Examples of Work
- Built a **Tableau dashboard** to visualize customer churn trends over time.  
- Authored **SQL scripts** to extract and transform sales data from a relational database.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** in RapidMiner to uncover patterns in marketing campaign performance.

## 3. Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement
While I’ve built a solid foundation, I see opportunities to grow in:

- **Data Interpretation:** Need to deepen my ability to translate analytical output into clear business recommendations.  
- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Eager to master more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., ensemble methods, deep learning).  
- **NoSQL & Big Data Tools:** Limited hands-on experience with MongoDB, Hadoop or Spark for large-scale, unstructured data.

### Steps for Improvement
- Enroll in an **advanced analytics** or **machine learning** course to strengthen interpretation skills.  
- Tackle **real-world data mining** projects using scikit-learn or TensorFlow.  
- Build a **MongoDB** prototype to handle and query unstructured datasets.

## 4. Integration with Other Curricular Areas

### Why Data Analytics Is Integratable
- **Data Management:** Clean, well-structured data is the bedrock of any reliable analysis.  
- **Software Systems:** Scripts and applications consume and present analytics results—bridging code and insight.  
- **Networking & Cybersecurity:** Anomaly detection and threat modeling rely on analytics techniques like pattern recognition and forecasting.

### How Data Analytics Integrates with My Prior Work
- Wrote **SQL queries** to feed cleaned data into visualization tools.  
- Applied **data mining** methods to cybersecurity logs during network scans.  
- Developed a **classification model in Python** to flag potential security incidents.

## 6. Conclusion
This assessment lays out my Data Analytics journey—what I excel at, where I plan to grow, and how these skills connect across my MS-CISBA curriculum. By strengthening my interpretation and machine-learning capabilities, while leveraging my database and visualization expertise, I’ll ensure my capstone project delivers actionable insights and real-world impact.
