# Networking & Cybersecurity Competency Assessment

## INTRODUCTION
This document summarizes my strengths, weaknesses, and integration of knowledge in Networking & Cybersecurity, as developed through **CIDM 6340** and **CIDM 6341**. These skills are foundational to developing secure digital systems and essential for my capstone and career readiness.

## COMPETENCIES & STRENGTHS
Through coursework and labs, I have built strengths in:

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Familiar with attack types, defense mechanisms, and security principles.
- **Security Audit & Risk Management:** Confident in designing audit plans and understanding contingency planning.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Experience using Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus, and Shields Up for vulnerability scanning and network inspection.
- **Information Security Policy & Compliance:** Developed documentation for security planning, policy enforcement, and regulatory compliance.

## WEAKNESSES AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Areas I plan to improve include:

- **Hands-on Networking Configuration:** I have theoretical understanding but need more hands-on experience with routing, firewalls, and access control lists (ACLs).
- **Incident Response & Forensics:** Want to strengthen practical skills in identifying and mitigating real-time threats.
- **Cloud Security:** Limited exposure to AWS/Azure security tools and best practices for securing cloud environments.

## STEPS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- Enroll in hands-on networking labs or virtual cyber ranges (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box).
- Take specialized online courses on **incident response, digital forensics**, and **cloud security**.
- Set up a small home lab to simulate attacks and defenses.

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER CURRICULAR AREAS
- **Software Systems:** Secure development practices ensure the systems I build are robust against vulnerabilities.
- **Data Management:** Securing data at rest and in transit is vital in relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Data Analytics:** Predictive models and anomaly detection are used to identify cyber threats and automate responses.

## INTEGRATION WITH PRIOR WORK
- Completed a **cybersecurity audit plan** for a simulated company.
- Used Wireshark to analyze network packets and detect suspicious traffic.
- Participated in classroom scenarios that involved **vulnerability scanning** and **security planning**.

## CONTRIBUTION TO THE CAPSTONE
Networking and Cybersecurity will guide how I design the **security architecture** of my capstone solution. Whether it involves user data or system interactions, I will apply principles of **risk management, compliance**, and **network hardening** to ensure secure design.
