# Software Systems Assessment

## 1. Introduction  
Software Systems Development is a critical aspect of modern information technology, encompassing the design, implementation, and maintenance of software solutions. This reflective appraisal explores my journey through the Software Systems curriculum, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and aspirations for future growth. It will serve as the Software Systems section of my capstone portfolio and prototype.

## 2. Competencies and Strengths  
Through CIDM6303 (Tech Foundations) and CIDM6330 (Software Engineering), I have developed proficiency in:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, and JavaScript for building scripts, CLI tools, and web applications.  
- **Software Development Lifecycle:** Familiar with requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases.  
- **Version Control:** Daily use of Git and GitHub for branching, merging, and collaborative development.  
- **Software Architecture:** Understanding of MVC, layered architectures, and design patterns that produce scalable, maintainable systems.

### Examples of Work  
- **Django Project Skeleton:** Set up a multi-app Django structure with routes for user input, analytics, and admin.  
- **Wireframe-to-HTML/CSS:** Converted PowerPoint mock-ups into responsive static pages, applying grid layouts and media queries.  
- **MVC CLI Tool:** Implemented a Python tool with separate model, view, and controller modules to load and display CSV data.

## 3. Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement  
While I have a solid foundation, I see opportunities to grow:

- **Advanced Design Patterns:** Limited hands-on with microservices, event-driven architecture, and domain-driven design.  
- **Cloud-Native Development:** Little experience with Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, or major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).  
- **Automated Testing & CI/CD:** Need to build robust unit/integration test suites and automate builds/deploys with tools like GitHub Actions.

## 4. Steps for Improvement  
- **Master Advanced Patterns:** Complete tutorials on microservices and event-driven design, then refactor a prototype into a service-based layout.  
- **Learn Containerization:** Build and deploy a Docker Compose stack for the capstone prototype; explore AWS Fargate or Azure Functions.  
- **Implement CI/CD:** Write pytest-based test suites and configure a GitHub Actions workflow for linting, testing, and automated deployment.

## 5. Integration with Other Curricular Areas  

### Why Software Systems Is Integratable  
Well-designed software is the backbone for analytics, data storage, and security. Every data-driven feature or access control mechanism runs inside a software system.

### How Software Systems Integrates with My Prior Work  
- **Data Analytics:** Embedded my `ss_loader.py` demo into a simple web form, demonstrating end-to-end data ingestion.  
- **Data Management:** Mapped Django models directly to the ERD-driven schema in SQLite/MySQL, ensuring clean data flow.  
- **Cybersecurity & Networking:** Applied role-based decorators from `flagfootball_demo.py` to secure API endpoints, following my security plan.

## 6. Conclusion  
I possess a strong Software Systems foundation—proficient in languages, architectures, and lifecycle practices. By deepening my expertise in advanced design patterns, cloud-native development, and automated testing, I will strengthen the prototype’s scalability, reliability, and maintainability. These improvements will ensure my capstone system not only meets functional requirements but also stands up to real-world deployment and collaboration needs.
