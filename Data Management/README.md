# Data Management Assessment

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an assessment of my competency in Data Management, highlighting my strengths, weaknesses, areas for improvement, and how my skills integrate with other areas of my coursework. This assessment will serve as a foundation for my capstone portfolio and prototype project.

## 2. Competencies and Strengths
Through my coursework, I have developed strong skills in the following areas:

- **SQL & Relational Databases:** Proficient in writing SQL queries, designing relational schemas, and managing structured data.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Skilled in creating ER models and Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) models to represent data structures efficiently.
- **Relational Schema Design & Normalization:** Capable of normalizing databases to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
- **Database Administration:** Familiar with database optimization, indexing, transaction management, and concurrency control.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):** Ability to define (DDL) and manipulate (DML) data in relational databases, including advanced SQL queries, stored procedures, and subqueries.
- **Data Governance & Security:** Understanding of compliance standards, access controls, and data integrity best practices.

### **Examples of Work**
- Designed and implemented a **relational database schema** for an enterprise project.
- Created **SQL queries** to extract, transform, and analyze business data.
- Implemented **database normalization** to optimize query performance and data consistency.

## 3. Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement
While I have developed strong skills, there are areas where I need improvement:

- **Big Data Management:** Limited experience working with large-scale data processing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark.
- **Advanced NoSQL Applications:** Need more experience in implementing NoSQL solutions beyond MongoDB.
- **Data Privacy Regulations & Compliance:** Need a deeper understanding of GDPR, HIPAA, and other global data governance policies.
- **Data Warehouses & Data Lakes:** Inexperienced in structuring large-scale data storage solutions for analytical purposes.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Inexposure to MongoDB for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.

### **Steps for Improvement**
- Enroll in **NoSQL and MongoDB courses** to improve proficiency in handling unstructured data.
- Work on **real-world projects** involving big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark.
- Study **data governance and security frameworks** to understand best practices in compliance and privacy.

## 4. Integration with Other Curricular Areas
### **Why Data Management is Integratable**
Data Management is a foundational aspect of data-driven applications, making it essential across multiple disciplines. It integrates seamlessly with:

- **Data Analytics:** Structured data stored in databases is crucial for effective analytics, machine learning models, and visualization.
- **Software Systems:** Applications rely on well-designed databases for efficient data retrieval, processing, and application performance.
- **Networking & Cybersecurity:** Secure and optimized database architectures are critical for maintaining data integrity, protecting against cyber threats, and implementing access control mechanisms.

### **How Data Management Integrates with My Prior Work**
- Applied **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes** for data preparation and analytics.
- Developed a **cybersecurity risk assessment database** to store and analyze threat intelligence data.
- Implemented **data access controls and encryption techniques** to enhance data security.

By combining **Data Management, Data Analytics, Software Systems, and Networking & Cybersecurity**, I can build scalable, secure, and efficient data-driven solutions. My capstone project will incorporate these skills, demonstrating their real-world application.

## 6. Conclusion
This assessment provides a roadmap for my capstone project, outlining my strengths, weaknesses, and integration across multiple domains. Moving forward, I will refine my skills in **NoSQL databases, big data management, and data governance** while leveraging my expertise in SQL and relational database systems. This will ensure my capstone project is comprehensive and impactful.
